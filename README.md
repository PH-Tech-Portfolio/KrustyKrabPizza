Used this tutorial as a learning resource better understand Asp.Net. This one was more about Razer pages rather than cousin MVC. from what I can tell they are basically the same but just have a slightly different way of working in terms of how the models communicate.

^^^Pretty good tutorial. 
Lots of similarities to MVC one. I would say in this one they promote their full course a lot but the info you get for 3hrs is pretty good.

## What I did? && What is Happening?
I first watched the tutorial then went back and created by own slightly different version of what they were teaching. Pretty similar to tutorial; added better styling. Styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and United style theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/united/). For the FAQ I added accordians and populated 2 of them with text I got from [TexTool](https://textool.io/unique-silly-article-generator). The Pizza images were provided by the YT tutorial; can be found here: [images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytclG0X8SP_nL8NC7oXprtWdbUCIe2u3/view?usp=sharing). We create pages and models in html, css, and c#. Entity framework is used when interacting with the db from SSMS. Currently getting sql db from docker; in future will switch to azure db bc then I will be able to access from wherever (Could also do that with docker but really don't want to). Note: prebuilt pizzas have different names in pictures than what I gave them. Something cool for the pizzas when you order is I learned to use data binding to pass information by link/url. Also learned how to properly use asp routing to pass parameters. Redirecting to other pages and passing parameters through object. Learned we can use post forms and submit buttons to submit form and deal with post in method benind the html razor page, in its model page (behind page is how I understand its relation).

I could add some more things. A couple of things I havent done but could do in future would be adding a login when I learn that. Add data validation when writing names or something. Also I could add more error checking bc I was very scamp with error checking in this one (focusing on learning). Could also fix the annoying case where if not enough contents on page the footer bar comes really high up. Only really noticable on thank you page but still a thing I could fix later. Could also take look at mobile layout. I have just been asssuming bootstarp will do something about that so really havent looked but could open dev tools and test it. Could change names on pizza images to match what I named them or just crop it out.
